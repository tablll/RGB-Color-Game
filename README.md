# RGB Color Game

This game is a project from a The Web Developer Bootcamp course, but i made changes to original conception.

Added win / loose logic, with scores calculations and how much clicks made.
Aded impossible difficlity.
Difficlity level now also change not only the number of squares but also the maximum number of click you can make.
Scores display, clicks display and color squares now made with flexbox.
And some more minor changes..
Actually now its looks more like a game:)
